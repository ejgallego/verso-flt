#doc (Manual) "Miniproject: Fujisaki's Lemma" =>

:::group "fujisaki_project"
Fujisaki's lemma packages the adelic compactness statement that underlies the
finiteness of many spaces of quaternionic automorphic forms.
:::

```tex "fujisaki_group_raw"
\section{The goal}

There is an idelic compactness statement which encapsulates both finiteness of the class
group of a number field and Dirichlet's units theorem about the rank of the unit group.
```

In fact there is even a noncommutative version of this statement. In John
Voight's book {Informal.citep voightBook}[] this is Main Theorem `27.6.14(a)`
and Voight calls it Fujisaki's lemma. I know nothing of the history but I'm
happy to adopt this name. In the quaternion algebra miniproject we will use
this compactness result to prove finite-dimensionality of a space of
quaternionic modular forms.

The compact quotient theorem for a division algebra is meant to be the
noncommutative analogue of the classical compactness of
$`K \backslash \mathbf{A}_K`.

```tex "commutative_prototype_raw"
The compact quotient theorem for a division algebra is meant to be the
noncommutative analogue of the classical compactness of
$`K \backslash \mathbf{A}_K`.
```

The TeX chapter uses this analogy repeatedly. The quotient
$`K \backslash \mathbf{A}_K`$ is the model case: a global field
embedded discretely in its adeles with compact quotient. Fujisaki's lemma asks
for the same style of compactness after replacing the commutative additive group
by the norm-one units in an adelic division algebra.

# Initial definitions

Let `K` be a field. A central simple `K`-algebra is a `K`-algebra `B` not
necessarily commutative with centre `K` such that `B` has exactly two two-sided
ideals, namely `{0}` and `B`. We will be concerned only with central simple
`K`-algebras which are finite-dimensional as `K`-vector spaces, and when `K` is
clear we will just refer to them as central simple algebras. We remark that a
`4`-dimensional central simple algebra is called a quaternion algebra; we will
have more to say about these later on.

```tex "fujisaki_initial_definitions_p1_raw"
Let $K$ be a field. A \emph{central simple $K$-algebra} is a $K$-algebra~$B$ (not necessarily
commutative) with centre $K$ such that $B$ has exactly two two-sided ideals, namely ${0}$ and $B$
(or $\bot$ and $\top$, as Lean would call them). We will be concerned
only with central simple $K$-algebras which are finite-dimensional as $K$-vector spaces, and
when $K$ is clear we will just refer to them as central simple algebras. We remark that a
4-dimensional central simple algebra is called a \emph{quaternion algebra}; we will have
more to say about these later on.
```

Matrix algebras `M_n(K)` are examples of finite-dimensional central simple
`K`-algebras. If `K = ℂ` or more generally if `K` is algebraically closed, then
matrix algebras are the only finite-dimensional examples up to isomorphism.

```tex "fujisaki_initial_definitions_p2_raw"
Matrix algebras $M_n(K)$ are examples of finite-dimensional central simple $K$-algebras.
If $K=\bbC$ (or more generally if $K$ is algebraically closed)
then matrix algebras are the only finite-dimensional examples
up to isomorphism.
```

There are other examples over the reals: for example Hamilton's quaternions
`ℍ := ℝ ⊕ ℝ i ⊕ ℝ j ⊕ ℝ k` with the usual rules `i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1`,
`ij = -ji = k` and so on are an example of a central simple `ℝ`-algebra, and
matrix algebras over `ℍ` are other central simple `ℝ`-algebras. For a general
field `K` one can make an analogue of Hamilton's quaternions
`K ⊕ Ki ⊕ Kj ⊕ Kk` with the same multiplication rules to describe the
multiplication, and if the characteristic of `K` is not `2` then this is a
quaternion algebra which may or may not be isomorphic to `M_2(K)`.

```tex "fujisaki_initial_definitions_p3_raw"
There are other examples over the reals: for example Hamilton's quaternions
$\bbH:=\R\oplus\R i\oplus\R j\oplus\R k$ with the usual rules $i^2=j^2=k^2=-1$,
$ij=-ji=k$ etc, are an example of a central simple $\R$-algebra (and a quaternion algebra), and
matrix algebras over $\bbH$ are other central simple $\R$-algebras.
For a general field $K$
one can make an analogue of Hamilton's quaternions $K\oplus Ki\oplus Kj\oplus Kk$ with the
same multiplication rules ($i^2=-1$ and so on) to describe the multiplication, and if the characteristic
of~$K$ isn't 2
then this is a quaternion algebra (which may or may not be isomorphic to $M_2(K)$ in this
generality).
```

Some central simple algebras `B` are division algebras, meaning that they are
division rings, or equivalently that every nonzero `b ∈ B` has a two-sided
inverse.
:::

Some central simple algebras~$B$ are \emph{division algebras}, meaning that they are division
rings, or equivalently that every nonzero $b\in B$ has a two-sided inverse. For example
Hamilton's quaternions are a division algebra over $\R$,
because $(x+yi+zj+tk)(x-yi-zj-tk)=x^2+y^2+z^2+t^2$, so the inverse
of a nonzero $x+yi+zj+tk$ is $(x-yi-zj-tk)/(x^2+y^2+z^2+t^2)$.
```

:::proof "division_algebra_hypothesis_for_fujisaki"
However `2 × 2` matrices over a field `K`, whilst being a central simple
algebra over `K`, are never a division algebra, because a nonzero matrix with
determinant zero such as
$`\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}`$ has no inverse.

# Enter the adeles

:::definition "adelic_division_algebra_setup" (parent := "fujisaki_project")
Let $`K`$ be a number field and let $`D/K`$ be a finite-dimensional central
simple $`K`$-algebra (later on $`D`$ will be a division algebra, hence the
name, but we do not need this yet). Then $`D_{\A}:=D\otimes_K\A_K`$ is an
$`\A_K`$-algebra which is free of finite rank, and if we give $`D_{\A}`$ the
$`\A_K`$-module topology then it is a topological ring. Furthermore
$`D_{\A}`$ is free of finite rank over the locally compact topological ring
$`\A_K`$ and is thus also locally compact. So by the theory of Haar characters
there is a canonical character
$`\delta_{D_{\A}}:D_{\A}^\times\to\R_{>0}`$ measuring how left multiplication
by an element of $`D_{\A}^\times`$ changes the additive Haar measure on
$`D_{\A}`$. Let $`D_{\A}^{(1)}`$ denote the kernel of $`\delta_{D_{\A}}`$, and
give it the subspace topology coming from $`D_{\A}^\times`.
:::

Then $D_{\A}:=D\otimes_K\A_K$ is an $\A_K$-algebra which
is free of finite rank, and if we give $D_{\A}$ the $\A_K$-module topology then it is
a topological ring (by results in mathlib). Furthermore $D_{\A}$ is free of finite
rank over the locally compact topological ring $\A_K$ and is thus also

```

One can furthermore check that if $`R`$ is a finite $`K`$-algebra then the
$`\A_K`$-module topologies and $`\A_{\Q}`$-module topologies on $`R_{\A}`$
coincide. Indeed, the topology on $`\A_K`$ is the $`\A_{\Q}`$-module topology,
as $`\A_K=\A_{\Q}\otimes_{\Q}K`$ as topological $`\A_{\Q}`$-algebras, where the
right hand side has the $`\A_{\Q}`$-module topology by definition.

\section{Enter the adeles}

The adeles of a number field are discussed in far more detail
in the adele miniproject \ref{Adele_miniproject}. We just recall here that if $K$ is a number field
then there are two huge commutative topological $K$-algebras called the \emph{finite adeles}
$\A_K^\infty$ and the \emph{adeles} $\A_K$ of $K$, and that they're both locally compact
as topological spaces. We also know from theorem~\ref{NumberField.AdeleRing.baseChangeEquiv}
that $\A_K\cong K\otimes_{\Q}\A_{\Q}K$ (both topologically and algebraically), meaning
that if $R$ is a $K$-algebra then $R_{\A} := R\otimes_K\A_K$ is naturally isomorphic
to $R\otimes_{\Q}\A_{\Q}$. One can
furthermore check that if $R$ is a finite $K$-algebra then the $\A_K$-module topologies and $\A_{\Q}$-module
topologies on $R_{\A}$ coincide. Indeed, the topology on $\A_K$
is the $\A_{\Q}$-module topology, as
$\A_K=\A_{\Q}\otimes_{\Q}K$ as topological $\A_{\Q}$-algebras, where the right hand side
has the $\A_{\Q}$-module topology by definition.

# The proof

:::theorem "NumberField.AdeleRing.DivisionAlgebra.Aux.existsE" (parent := "fujisaki_project") (lean := "NumberField.AdeleRing.DivisionAlgebra.Aux.existsE")
There is a compact subset `E ⊆ D_A` such that for every
$`\beta \in D_A^{(1)}`, the translated set `βE` cannot inject into the quotient
$`D \backslash D_A`.
:::

```tex "large_compact_set_mod_d_exists_raw"
\begin{lemma}
  \label{NumberField.AdeleRing.DivisionAlgebra.Aux.existsE}
  \lean{NumberField.AdeleRing.DivisionAlgebra.Aux.existsE}
  \leanok
  There's a compact subset $E$ of $D_{\A}$
  with the property that for all $x\in D_{\A}^{(1)}$,
  the obvious map $xE\to D\backslash D_{\A}$ is not injective.
\end{lemma}
```

:::proof "NumberField.AdeleRing.DivisionAlgebra.Aux.existsE"
After choosing a `\mathbf{Q}`-basis of `D`, one identifies `D_A` with a finite
power of `\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{Q}}`,
so the quotient `D \backslash D_A` inherits compactness from
`ℚ \backslash \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{Q}}`.

One then chooses a compact set whose Haar measure is larger than the measure of
the quotient. Any translate of that set must then intersect two points mapping
to the same quotient class.
:::

```tex "large_compact_set_mod_d_exists_proof_raw"
\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  We know that if we pick a $\Q$-basis for $D$
  of size $d$ then this identifies $D$ with $\Q^d$,
  $D_{\A}$ with $\A_{\Q}^d$, and $D\backslash D_{\A}$ with
  $(\Q\backslash\A_{\Q})^d$. Now $\Q$ is discrete in $\A_{\Q}$
  by theorem~\ref{NumberField.AdeleRing.discrete}, and the quotient
  $\Q\backslash \A_{\Q}$ is compact by theorem~\ref{Rat.AdeleRing.cocompact}.
  Hence $D$ is discrete in $D_{\A}$
  and the quotient $D\backslash D_{\A}$ is compact.
\end{proof}

The TeX proof says that if `βE` fails to inject into the quotient, then two
distinct points of `βE` differ by a nonzero element of `D`, and because `D` is
a division algebra that difference lies in `D^×`. Since the original points
differ by an element of `X`, the translate `βX` meets `D^×`.
:::

```tex "difference_set_meets_d_units_left_for_fujisaki_proof_raw"
\begin{proof}
  \leanok
Indeed by lemma~\ref{NumberField.AdeleRing.DivisionAlgebra.Aux.existsE},
the map $\beta E\to D\backslash D_{\A}$
isn't injective, so there are distinct
$\beta e_1,\beta e_2\in \beta E$ with $e_i\in E$ and
$\beta e_1-\beta e_2=b\in D$.
Now $b\not=0$ and $D$ is a division algebra, so $b\in D^\times$.
And $e_1-e_2\in X$ so $b=\beta(e_1-e_2)\in \beta X$, so we're done.

The right-multiplication argument is the same after using the Haar-measure
symmetry for central simple algebras to pass from left multiplication by
`β⁻¹` to right multiplication.

  \uses{NumberField.AdeleRing.DivisionAlgebra.Aux.E, NumberField.AdeleRing.isCentralSimple_addHaarScalarFactor_left_mul_eq_right_mul}
  Indeed, $\beta^{-1}\in D_{\A}^{(1)}$, and so left multiplication by $\beta^{-1}$
  doesn't change Haar measure on $D_{\A}$, so neither does right multiplication
  (by theorem~\ref{NumberField.AdeleRing.isCentralSimple_addHaarScalarFactor_left_mul_eq_right_mul}).
  So the same argument works: $E\beta^{-1}\to D\backslash D_{\A}$ is not
  injective so choose $e_1\beta^{-1}\not=e_2\beta^{-1}$ with difference $b\in D$
  and then $(e_1-e_2)\beta^{-1}\in D-{0}=D^\times$.

The TeX proof uses only general topology. `Y` is compact, `D` is a discrete
additive subgroup of `D_A`, hence closed, so `Y ∩ D` is compact and discrete and
therefore finite. Since `T ⊆ Y ∩ D`, the set `T` is finite as well.

  It suffices to prove that $Y\cap D$ is finite.
    But $D\subseteq D_{\A}$ is a discrete additive subgroup, and hence closed.
    And $Y\subseteq D_{\A}$ is compact.
    So $D\cap Y$ is compact and discrete, so finite.

`βx₁ = b₁` and `x₂β⁻¹ = b₂` with `b_i ∈ D^×` and `x_i ∈ X`. Note that
`β ∈ D_A^{(1)}` and `b_i ∈ D^× \subseteq D_A^{(1)}` by

`x_i ∈ D_A^{(1)}` as well. In
particular `x_i ∈ D_A^×`, so `x₁⁻¹` makes sense.

Multiplying the equations defining the `x_i` and `b_i`, we deduce that
`x₂x₁ = b₂b₁ ∈ Y ∩ D^× = T`; call this element `t`. Then
`x₁⁻¹ = t⁻¹x₂ ∈ T⁻¹X`, and `x₁ ∈ X`, so if we set `ν = x₁⁻¹` and `b = b₁`

There's a natural map $\alpha$ from $D^\times\backslash D_{\A}^{(1)}$ to
  $D^\times\backslash (D\otimes_K \A_K^\infty)^\times$. We claim that it's
  surjective. Granted this claim, we are home, because if we put the quotient
  topology on $D^\times\backslash (D\otimes_K \A_K^\infty)^\times$ coming from
  $(D\otimes_K \A_K^\infty)^\times$ then it's readily verified that $\alpha$
  is continuous, and the continuous image of a compact space is compact.

  As for surjectivity: say $x\in (D\otimes_K \A_K^\infty)^\times$. We need to extend
  $x$ to an element $(x,y)\in (D\otimes_K \A_K^\infty)^\times\times(D\otimes_K K_\infty)^\times$
  which is in the kernel of $\delta_{D_{\A}}$. Because $\delta_{D_{\A}}(x,1)$ is some positive
  real number, it will suffice to show that if $r$ is any positive real number then we can
  find $y\in (D\otimes_K \A_K^\infty)^\times=(D\otimes_{\Q}\R)^\times$ with $\delta_{D_{\A}}(1,y)=r$,
  or equivalently (setting $D_{\R}=D\otimes_{\Q}\R$) that $\delta_{D_{\R}}(y)=r$.
  But $D\not=0$ as it is a division algebra,and hence $\Q\subseteq D$, meaning
  $\R\subseteq D_{\R}$, and if
  $x\in\R^\times\subseteq D_{\R}^\times$ then $\delta(x)=|x|^d$ with $d=\dim_{\Q}(D)$,
  as multiplication by $x$ is just scaling by a factor of $x$ on $D_{\R}\cong\R^d$.
  In particular we can set $x=y^{1/d}$.

There's a natural map `α` from

As for surjectivity: say
`x ∈ (D \otimes_K \mathbf{A}_K^\infty)^\times`. We need to extend `x` to an
element
`(x,y) ∈ (D \otimes_K \mathbf{A}_K^\infty)^\times × (D \otimes_K K_\infty)^\times`
which is in the kernel of `δ_{D_A}`. Because `δ_{D_A}(x,1)` is some positive

then we can find
`y ∈ (D \otimes_K \mathbf{A}_K^\infty)^\times = (D \otimes_\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{R})^\times`
with `δ_{D_A}(1,y)=r`, or equivalently, setting
`D_\mathbf{R} = D \otimes_\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{R}`, that `δ_{D_\mathbf{R}}(y)=r`.
But `D ≠ 0` as it is a division algebra, and hence
`\mathbf{Q} \subseteq D`, meaning `\mathbf{R} \subseteq D_\mathbf{R}`, and if
`x ∈ \mathbf{R}^\times \subseteq D_\mathbf{R}^\times` then
